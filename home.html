  <h1>CONSTANZA</h1>
  <p class="home-text">Hello.</p>

<p class="home-text">I live in Santiago, Chile, but I crave being somewhere else most of the time, just out of curiosity — nothing personal.</p>

 <p class="home-text"> During the last years, I’ve worked as Communications Director for a New York City Council Member, 
  earned a Master’s in International Business from the University of South Carolina, and worked as a copywriter and content analyst.</p>
  
  <p class="home-text"> I’m interested in acting, writing my thoughts, and reading,
    and often find myself talking about Jimmy Fallon.</p>

  <p class="home-text">There’s also a place where I share thoughts and behind-the-scenes stuff:
